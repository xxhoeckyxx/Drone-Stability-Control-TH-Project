# Control system for stabilizing a drone

The aim of this project is to develop a control system for a drone that ensures stable flight and maintenance of its position in the air. The system will regulate the drone's movements by dynamically adjusting its orientation, reacting to external forces and compensating for disturbances. The control algorithm will be implemented with an ESP32 microcontroller that uses real-time sensor data to provide feedback and corrections. 

This project will integrate components from a previous ESP32-based motorcycle data protocol system. Flight stabilization of the drone will be achieved through PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loops or similar techniques that provide smooth and responsive control inputs. 

The project is modular and allows for future extensions and the possible integration of additional functions such as autonomous flying or obstacle avoidance.  

### Key features: 
 - Real-time flight stabilization with ESP32
 - Implementation of control algorithms 
 - Integration of motion sensors for precise positioning 
 - Modular and expandable design  
 
This repository serves as the primary collaboration space for the development of the control system. Contributions are welcome.
